## ⭐ READ THIS FIRST

**Previous versions had a code error.** This is the **working version** that uses the correct Apps Script API.

## 🎯 What's Different

**v6.5.1 (Broken):** Tried to use `.setHeaders()` - doesn't exist in Apps Script  
**v6.5.2 (Working):** Uses proper Apps Script API - CORS handled by Google automatically

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read** `START_HERE.md` (3-minute guide)
2. **Copy** `apps_script/WebApp.gs`
3. **Deploy** with "Anyone" access
4. **Done!**

## ✅ What This Fixes

- ✅ TypeError: setHeaders is not a function
- ✅ CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing
- ✅ Status code: 405 errors
- ✅ All proxy functionality

## 🎓 How It Works

Apps Script **automatically adds CORS headers** when you deploy with "Anyone" access. You don't need to add them in code!

The working code:
- Uses proper `ContentService` API
- Returns correct JSON responses
- Handles all actions (ping, setupsheet, appendrecord, etc.)
- Works with Apps Script's CORS system

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Use `apps_script/WebApp.gs` (the working version)
- [ ] Deploy as "Web app"
- [ ] Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
- [ ] Copy Web App URL (ends with /exec)
- [ ] Update Proxy URL in Settings
- [ ] Add Spreadsheet ID
- [ ] Save Settings
- [ ] Test with "Ping Proxy"

## 🎉 Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ Ping Proxy: "Proxy OK"
- ✅ Setup Sheet: Headers created
- ✅ Add Record: Appears in sheet
- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ All features working

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About CORS
CORS is handled **automatically by Google** when you deploy with "Anyone" access. Your code doesn't need to set CORS headers.

### About Security
"Anyone" access means anyone with your Spreadsheet ID can use the proxy. Keep your Spreadsheet ID private. Without it, no one can access your data.

### About Previous Versions
If you deployed v6.5.1, archive that deployment and create a new one with this working code.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still getting errors?
1. Make sure you're using `apps_script/WebApp.gs` from THIS package
2. Verify deployment access is "Anyone"
3. Check you're using the NEW Web App URL
4. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### TypeError about setHeaders?
You're still using the old code. Replace with `apps_script/WebApp.gs` from this package.

### CORS errors?
Check deployment access is set to "Anyone" - this enables automatic CORS.
